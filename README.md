# BugBreaker
Familiarize yourself with common bugs and their solutions with this community-built leetcode style game.

How to play:
On each level, you will be given a faulty code snippet, the error it produces, and the relevant code context. To move on, you must modify the code in a way that resolves the error.

How to contribute to the game:
Ever come across the same bug over and over again? Ever come across a bug that took forever to figure out or a maybe even a bug you haven't figured out yet? Submit the faulty code and your suggested solution (if you have one) and we'll add it in to the rotation!
You can also submit a translation of a bug that exists in our database in a different language. We started with Javascript, but we want users to be able to play levels in TypeScript, Python, and any other language you find bugs in!
